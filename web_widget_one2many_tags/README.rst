Bug Tracker
===========

Bugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/web/issues>`_. In
case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.
If you spotted it first, help us smash it by providing detailed and welcomed
feedback.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* as one2many fields are cached on the client side until the user hits `Save`
  on the main form, no ``name_get`` can be called on those records, which is
  why changes that update the display name are not reflected until saving, and
  new records are displayed as `New record` until then. If you don't like this,
  add the field `display_name` to your form and have it recomputed in an
  @onchange handler.
